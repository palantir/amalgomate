    Updates amalgomate to operate on modules.

    * Determine files to copy based on module information
    * Rewrite imports based on module information
    * Remove configuration values that are no longer relevant in module mode

    After this change, amalgomate no longer supports amalgomating packages
    that are not part of a declared module.
