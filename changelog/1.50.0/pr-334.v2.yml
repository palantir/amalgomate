improvement:
  description: Adds the "do-not-rewrite-flag-import" option to configuration, which
    allows specifying the relative paths to files for which the "flag" import should
    not be rewritten to an amalgomated version. This is useful when amalgomating files
    that may use the "flag" package to pass or interpret data structures (but not
    for the flags on the program itself).
